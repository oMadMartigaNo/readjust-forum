## Compiling assets

Bootstrap for Vanilla was scaffolded using [Ninja](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-ninja). For instructions on how to install the development dependencies and front-end components, please refer to the [Ninja documentation](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-ninja#getting-started). Once you've got everything set up, use the following tasks to re-compile the theme assets:

#### Build - `gulp`
Runs the default Gulp task which will compile all theme assets. LESS stylesheets will be compiled to [`design/style.css`](design/style.css) and Javascripts will be concatenated and output to [`js/custom.js`](js/custom.js).

#### Watch - `gulp watch`
Starts an instance of [tiny-lr](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr) (a tiny LiveReload server) that watches the compiled assets for changes and pushes these to your Vanilla installation automatically whenever they change.

## Customizations

Bootstrap for Vanilla supports tools such as [Bootstrap Magic](http://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic/app) out-of-the-box. All custom variables go in [`less/variables.less`](less/variables.less) and will override all those set by both Bootstrap itself as well as any extensions made by Bootstrap for Vanilla. For more in-depth customizations, [`less/custom.less`](less/custom.less) has been made available.

## [Issue tracking](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-bootstrap/issues)

If you come across any bugs or if you have a feature request, please file an issue using the GitHub Issue tracker. Bootstrap for Vanilla won't be supported through http://vanillaforums.org so please stick to using GitHub for inquiries about bugs and feature requests. Thanks!
