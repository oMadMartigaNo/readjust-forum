###About this project
This is a public repository of our discussion forum. We're using [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.org) running on a custom theme based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) made by [Kasper Kronborg Isager](https://github.com/kasperisager/VanillaBootstrap).

###Why a public repo?
We're cheap bastards (since public repos are free at Github), plus it is always nice to share what we do. We do however recommend you to download [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.org) directly instead of using our messy, very custom, stuff. :)
